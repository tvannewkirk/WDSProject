<h1>Windows Deployment Services Imaging Project</h1>

<h2>Description and Procedure</h2>
I used a Windows 10 Enterprise virtual machine to create an image for workstations in the domain to boot from. I created and formatted another partition using disk management in order to allow the image to be stored. After installing the applications, I ran Sysprep to allow the image to be deployed to other computers. 

I booted the virtual machine into winPE and copied the image to the partition that I created using the dism command within command prompt. T
